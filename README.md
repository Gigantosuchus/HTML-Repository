**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for documents intended to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the structure and content of a webpage. HTML uses elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images to create the skeleton of a webpage.

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a style sheet language that describes the presentation and styling of a document written in HTML. It allows you to change the look and feel of a webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. CSS helps make websites visually appealing and user-friendly.

Together, HTML and CSS form the backbone of modern web development, and they are often complemented by scripting languages like JavaScript for interactivity.
